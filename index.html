                        <h2>About Sia.</h2>
                        <p>Hi, my name is Sia Gupta and I am a Senior at Dublin High School. My career goal is to become a Mechanical Engineer specializing in 3D printing for applications in biomimetics. I am currently working toward getting my degree in mechanical engineering. I am very passionate about Computer Integrated Manufacturing in the biomimetics field. 
                        </p>
                        <p>I am currently doing research with Dr. Yang of San Diego State University in an application of 3D printing called biomimetics (the replication of natural bioinspired microstructures) taught me a lot about the development atmosphere of engineers. This project allowed me to experience the real atmosphere of research and the science community. Using the super hydrophilic properties of the Salvinia Molesta plant, we found some of the applications of the project to be used for three-dimensional cell culture, oil pollution removal, and underwater robotics to become more efficient processes, all of which further research in their prospective fields. I collaborate with graduate students to help to synthesize our work in a detailed manner while being concise. I contribute to the conceptualization of the designs through hands-on development using computer-aided software like Fusion 360 and SolidWorks. The culture of research shocked me and I felt like what I was doing was important to the future. This opportunity emphasized to me that I want to pursue mechanical engineering because of the culture of innovation.

   <h3 style="margin-left: 100px;">Field Trips</h3>
   <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;margin-top: 10px;"> One Virtual Field Trip I attended was the Junior Achievement Engineering Exploration field trip. I met with 2 data scientists, Keerthana Bhaskaran, and Manikant Kapuganti who worked in the cloud business to improve the speeds of the queries. The main objective of their job is to test ways to scale the number of results coming from the cloud as well as maintain efficiency while doing so. They both are working on improving the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. I gained valuable insight on the ever-expanding cloud industry.  </p>
   <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;margin-top: 10px;">Another field trip that I attended was to Lawrence Livermore Lab where I had the opportunity to meet with Carl Earl. Carl Earl is the head of the High Computing Department, and he explained the history of supercomputers. Supercomputers are used to run calculations at much faster speed than the amount that humans can do manually. Carl showed us a simulation of one of the programs that the supercomputer is used for, which was an environment simulator. The Lawrence Livermore Lab also has one of the biggest supercomputers named Sierra. Sierra is used by the United States government. The biggest takeaway from Carl was that we always need to be curious about our careers, and think about past technology and ways to improve it. 
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;margin-top: 10px;">An In-person field trip, I had an opportunity to go to Workday. Workday is a company known for its expertise in finding computer-based solutions for businesses to help their clients in an effective manner. I learned about the company atmosphere and spoke to many software developers who all emphasized how their own learning in engineering and their fields has continued to grow. I learned of Xpresso which is a object-model programming language that cut down development time significantly and it helped to build and modify features for production to happen quicker.
  </p>
  <p  style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;margin-top: 10px;">Another Virual Field Trip that I also went on was to the Salesforce virtual fieldtrip. I heard from many engineers about building products to tend to customer databases. With this challenge came the concerns of saving information securely in the cloud. As a result, cybersecurity teams constantly work on securing the cloud and their servers to encrypt information and protect Salesforceâ€™s interests and clients.

  <h3 style="margin-left: 100px; margin-top: 50px;">Guest Speakers</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;margin-top: 10px;">One of the Guest Speakers that I had the chance to hear from is Winnie Kuang. She works in the aerospace department at NASA. Winnie, as an intern at Nasa, worked on potential models for the successor of the mars 2020 rover. Later on, Winnie joined NASA as an employee and now works on vertical lift technology and rotorcraft design. The biggest takeaway from Winnie was to be persistent and stay dedicated to your work. 
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;margin-top: 10px;">Trisha Shah is a Dublin High Alumni who graduated in 2017. She is a Management Information Systems Major. Itâ€™s a degree that is a cross-section of business and Computer Science. Trisha has her own nonprofit that is dedicated to creating The most important takeaways from Trisha were to be confident, do things you enjoy career-related, focus on improving yourself as a person and careerwise, and most importantly donâ€™t do anything you donâ€™t enjoy.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;margin-top: 10px;"> Aileen Iniguez is a data scientist who works at Chevron who explained the origins of her stem career as a low income female student. Her story was deeprooted in the concepts of finding one's passion and constant pursuing oppurtunities to work and advance in the fields. I learned more ways to get involved with my learning and to develop more meaningful relationships with peers and potential colleagues. </p>
 
  <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;margin-top: 10px;"> Jason Yosinki is an AI specialist, working on PHD level theses to develop more depthful knowledge of AI and machine learning into our lives as tool. He works to create mathmatical models to represent AI's theoreticals and performance levels as well. From Jason, I learned about what it means to truly envelop in curiousity to learn and develop as an engineer. 
  
  </p>
  <h3 style="margin-left: 100px; margin-top: 50px;">Mentorship Program</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;margin-top: 10px;">My mentor was Patrick Blonigan, a Senior Computer Scientist at Sandia National Labs. He currently leads several projects related to research and development of novel tools for computational physics simulations, mostly simulations of the air flowing around high-speed air/spacecraft in flight. The simulations allow Sandia to consider important flight regimes. Being mentored by him, gave me an in-depth experience of his career and also relate it to my own passions in physical engineering aspect that I hope to pursue as a career. I also was able to work with him to develop myself professionally and be ready for when I step into the professional world especially.

                        Through this project we learned how to use Github creating pull and push requests, setting up personal access tokens, creating branches, and maintaining code
                         as a working group of developers and coders. We all also wrote methods in order to have the students do something.
