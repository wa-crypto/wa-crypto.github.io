                        <h2>About Sia.</h2>
                        <p>Hi, my name is Sia Gupta and I am a Sophmore at Dublin High School. My career goal is to become a Computer Engineer. I am currently working toward getting my degree in computer science and engineering. I am actively looking for internships and other opportunities to get real -world experience of the tech world. Something that inspired me to look into computer science, was our tremendous usage of computers in our daily life.</p>
                        <p>I will be a valuable asset as I am passionate about my work. This passion has led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to do better work. As a Sophomore in high school, I have worked on multiple projects to explore entrepreneurship/design development  in the tech world with Industry experts like Dr. Anurag Mairal- Stanford Biodesign Professor, Jon Fjeld-- The Chair of Entrepreneurship at Duke University’s School of Business, Howard Marks- Co-founder and Co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management. An opportunity that I am currently working on with Google is a project called Webboot with Ron Minnich-firmware engineer. All these projects have shown me different aspects of the tech world and gauged my understanding of the career I want to go into. Additionally, I am currently taking Principles of Engineering to explore more mechanical engineering. Last year, I took AP Computer Science Principles. I plan on taking AP Computer Science Applications next year.  
                        </p>
                        <p>At school, I am a part of the varsity badminton team at school. I learned from both of these things that being a team-player requires responsibility and dependability to your team. This applies toward working toward becoming a software engineer, because engineers often work together and need to be reliant on each other, and being experienced in this, I can be a good asset. Outside of school, I am playing badminton professionally and self-learning javascript. I am self-motivated and that allows me to follow my passions and get where I want to be.
                        </p>

						<p style="font-size: 15px;">One Virtual Field Trip I attended was at Oracle. I met 2 data scientists, Keerthana Bhaskaran and Manikant Kapuganti  who worked in the cloud business to improve speeds of the queries. The main objective of their job is to test ways to scale the amount of results coming from the cloud as well as maintaining the efficiency while doing so. They both are working on improving the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. This experience was really memorable because it showed me that people choose their careers based on what problems that they want to solve in the world.  </p>
						<p style="font-size: 15px;">Another field trip that I attended was to Lawrence Livermore Lab. I initially went into this call thinking that this would be more science heavy, but I noticed that most of the careers presented were more relevant to Computer Science or applied Computer Science with 
						</p>
					</div>
					<p class= "col-sm-12"style="font-size: 15px;">other types of Sciences. I met with Carl Earl. Carl Earl was in the High Computing Department, and he explained the history of supercomputers. Supercomputers are used to run calculations at much faster speed than the amount that humans can do manually. Carl showed us a simulation of one of the programs that the supercomputer is used for, which was an environment simulator. The Lawrence Livermore Lab also has one of the biggest supercomputers named Sierra. Sierra is used by the United States government. The biggest takeaway from Carl was that we always need to be curious about our career, and think about past technology and ways to improve it. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class= "col-sm-12"style="font-size: 15px;">Guest Speakers that I met this year are Winnie Kuang and Trisha Shah. They work in the aerospace department at NASA. Winnie, as intern at Nasa worked on potential models for the successor for the mars 2020 rover. Later on Winnie joined nasa as an employee and now works on vertical lift technology, and rotocraft design. The biggest takeaway from Winnie was to be persistent and stay dedicated to your work. Trisha Shah is a Dublin High Alumni who graduated in 2017. She is an Management Information Systems Major. It’s a degree that is a crossection of business and Computer Science. Trisha has her own nonprofit that is dedicated to creating The most important takeaways from Trisha were to be confident, do things you enjoy career-related, focus on improving yourself as a person and careerwise, and most importantly don’t do anything you don’t enjoy.

                      <p style="padding:20px;">The purpose of the Upcycling Project is to learn about how products thrown in the recycling bin can be recycled to create other products. 
                          I learned about how plastics are recycled by their material types. We also learned a lot about Materials testing, which is the process of testing materials to make products with good quality.
                          A skill that I learned in this project was the ability to sell products like an entrepreneur and marketer. I also learned ways to material test different fabrics through tensile tests, comfort, heat resistance and many other factors. 
                          I worked on this project with a team, I was the team manager and the people working with me were Diya Menon and Saachi Binani.
